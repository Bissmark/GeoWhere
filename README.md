# Team Experience:
### David: 
Had to learn to communicate with teamates and consistently update on where we are to avoid at least conflict as possible. I mainly did the CSS and was repsonsible for positioning the game and navigations. Had to deal with a few git issues and had learnt alot with tailwind CSS and react routing.
